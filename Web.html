        <p style="font-size: 3vw">Hello! I don't know if you're going to ever see this little website on the outskirts of the internet, but if you do see this before Christmas break, or even after, then first of all, wow! You might have read through the back of the entire paper. Impressive! In all seriousness though
        I would like to thank you, as a student, for all that you put into the classroom. I know it takes a lot of time and energy to do constantly stay attentive to the needs of your students, and it is not only very admirable but very appreciated as well. Since I have so much more makeup work to do, I don't have time right now
        to write too much more on this, but I just hope you know you're appreciated. Thank you and have a wonderful break!</p>
